        <p>'m building an application that uses Hibernate and Mysql, My entire databse has 15 tables. Here is the problem: I
          start inserting records into the database and viewing them using query.list(); to get the added records, howerver
          after a while of getting "correct" results, I start not having the last record I added, I add again and it's the
          same(the one that was showing before shows but not the last one I added), I refresh and I get the right records,
          I refresh again and I get 32 records instead of 43, I'm not using any complicated queries just a Select with a
          condition, as you can see this is really weird.</p>
